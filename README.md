# AHK-Batch-Fast-Copy-Paste-Filenames-No-SMX-Extension
Iterates through all .smx filenames in a folder, copying the bare filename (no .smx) to the clipboard. 
Automatically copies the next filename after you paste using the backtick \[`] key

Usage
Download Autohotkey, then double click copyfilenames.ahk

Tip
You can remap the paste key to a key closer to your enter key, it's inside the .ahk file

Modifying the batch file is pretty easy, for example you want to come back and do this with a list of Internal Names, just save it as .txt files and change \*.smx to \*.txt
Or create one big txt file with all your strings and iterate line by line. i think it's pretty simple to modify the batch file, I just happened to have lots of graphics files in a folder
